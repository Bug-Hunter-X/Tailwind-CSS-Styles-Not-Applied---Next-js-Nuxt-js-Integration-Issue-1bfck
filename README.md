This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when integrating Tailwind CSS into Next.js or Nuxt.js projects. The problem is that the Tailwind styles are not being applied to the components, leaving them unstyled. This can stem from different causes, such as incorrect configuration within the build process, errors in importing the necessary styles, or conflicts with other CSS frameworks used alongside Tailwind CSS. This repository offers a step-by-step reproduction of the bug, along with a clear solution, offering guidance for solving similar issues and preventing similar problems in the future.
