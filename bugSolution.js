To resolve this issue, ensure that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured in your project. Check the `tailwind.config.js` file for the correct paths to your CSS files. Then, make sure that the necessary Tailwind directives are included in your CSS file (`src/app/globals.css` in this example) and that the styles are correctly imported into your application's entry point. Next.js and Nuxt.js might require specific setup steps, detailed in their respective documentation.  If problems persist, review Tailwind CSS documentation, search for similar issues online, or check for conflicts with other libraries or CSS frameworks.
